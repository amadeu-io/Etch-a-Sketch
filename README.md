Etch a Sketch web app ✏️

The app consists of a blank grid made of squares that get painted when the cursor 
hovers over them

The grid is made of div's that change style on hover. The grid size can be changed (2 up to 40 squares per side). The size of the divs adjusts depending on the grid size so the canvas they are contained in never changes

Black is the default paint

When the raibow toggle is on, each square gets painted in a random color. The rainbow toggle can 
be turned off or back on at any time

This was a heck of a JavaScript workout 🏋️

<b>Potential Improvements:</b> 💪

 - Double click on grid size for manual add
 - Rainbow mode only shows maximum saturation colors
 - Mobile compatible

<b>Found Bugs:</b> 🪲

 - Rainbow toggle automatically turns off if grid size is changed
 - Raingow toggle stops working if it's used without painting in between
 - Laggy for higher grid sizes
