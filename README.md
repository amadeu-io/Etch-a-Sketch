Etch a Sketch web app ✏️

This app is currently being developed.

The app consists of a blank grid made of squares that get painted when the cursor 
hovers over them.

The grid is made of div's that change style on hover. The grid size can be changed by the user,
from 2 up to 40, by default it is set to 16. For higher grid sizes, it's a little laggy. The size of the divs adjust depending on the grid size so the canvas they are contained in never changes size.

By default, the paint color is black.

When the raibow toggle is on, each square gets painted in a random RGB color.The rainbow toggle can 
be turned off or back on at any time.

**Potential Improvements:** 💪

 - Double click on grid size for manual add
 - Rainbow mode only shows maximum saturation colors

**Found Bugs:** 🪲

 - Rainbow toggle automatically turns off if grid size is changed
